1. For Task0, it requires retrieving one record from specific memory address, so it takes constant time, 0(1)
2. For Task1, it reiterates through combined array of texts and calls, and do constant time operations, so total complexity is O(n) as n is input size.
3. For Task2, for n element of the calls list  only part of each element gets compared each time, so time complexity is 0(n).
4. For Task3, from_bangalore and to_bangalore phone calls count takes O(n) and sorted function of python does a merge sort so takes O(nlogn) . So total complexity is O(nlogn).
5. For Task4, iterating two lists takes linear time each, So O(n) followed by sorted which takes O(nlong), followed by linear time to loop through for printing so another O(n).So
overall time complexity is O(nlogn).
